## Info For Collaborators
You need to create a new branch for your assignments and then push your code to that specific branch only.

> ## Process
> ### 1) You need to clone this repository on your local machine

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need an access token because Github CLI now don't allow users to authenticate using username and password.

> For creating a personal access token, go to [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new classic token. Set its expiration date to "No expiration" or to "Custom" and set the date to the end of semester so you won't need to create another token again. After token generation, save that token somewhere on you local machine, by copy and pasting that token in a text file, because it will disappear once you close the window or go to some other tab.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to replace "username" and "token" with your own username and the token you have just created!

> ```bash
>   git clone https://username:token@github.com/jammer345/Digital-Image-Processing.git
> ```
>
> 
> ### 2) Create a new branch for your code
>
> After your have cloned this repository, open the folder that is created, in CMD and use the given command to create new branch.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to replace "yourname" with your actual name!

> ```
>   git checkout -b assignments/yourname
> ```
> Example: git checkout -b assignments/syedanwaar
>
> ### 3) Check your current branch
> ```
>   git branch
> ```
> It will give a result like this:
>
> * assignments/yourname
>   
>   main
> 
>   assignments/othercollaboratorname
> 
>   assignments/othercollaboratorname
>
> ### 4) Write code and complete your assignments
>
> Now you are at your own branch and here you can write the code and complete your assignments. Make sure to create separate folder for each assignment.
>
> ### 5) Push your code
>
> After completing your assignment, its time for pushing the code to the remote repository in your own branch.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never push code to the main branch. First check the branch on which you are working.
> 
> ```
>   git branch
> ```
> It will give you a result just like before, and if you are on some other branch, you can switch to your own branch
> ```
>   git switch assignments/yourname
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> On this repository, never switch to any other branch, It will cause alot of conflicts in your code which migth get you in trouble. If you want to practice, clone this repo in another
> folder and practice there.
